# Week 3 Project: Data Analysis and Git Workflow

## Overview
This project focuses on learning and applying Git version control, Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) with GitHub Actions, and Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA). It includes tasks related to managing repositories, analyzing data, and automating workflows.

## Goals
1. Use Git for version control.
2. Set up CI/CD pipelines with GitHub Actions.
3. Perform data analysis to gain insights from data.

## Project Structure
- `main`: Main branch containing the final and approved code.
- `task-1`: Branch for the initial Git setup, CI/CD pipeline, and EDA.
- Additional branches will be created for other tasks.

## Tasks in Week 3
### Task 1: Git and GitHub Setup
- Create a GitHub repository for the project.
- Set up GitHub Actions for CI/CD.
- Perform version control with Git (commits, branches, and pull requests).

### Task 2: Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Summarize data (e.g., descriptive statistics).
- Visualize distributions and relationships in the data.
- Discover actionable insights.

### Future Tasks
- Data version control using DVC.
- A/B testing for hypothesis validation.
- Building statistical and machine learning models.
